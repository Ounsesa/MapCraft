Welcome to this game
"Since I’m unable to do art, I’ll have to explain some things"
What you see in the middle of the screen is the Map
"You can place Pieces on the map, if the Piece fits"
and there are no other Pieces in that spot
Try and place this Piece
"Now, that Piece generates Materials every cycle"
You can see it at the top
"Now, you can start crafting other pieces."
Click the top right square.
"Here, you see a 3x3 grid. "
This is where you craft your pieces
"To craft a piece, you need Tiles"
At the top you see how many tiles you have
"At the right, you can craft those tiles using the Materials you just got"
"Using Materials, you craft Resource Tiles"
"And using Resources, you craft Material Tiles"
"While reading, you should have generated a few materials"
Try to craft some Resources Tiles
"Then, select the Resources Craft at the top"
And create the Piece with the shape you like
In case you crafted a Piece that doesn’t fit
or that you don’t like the shape
You can toss it by clicking the bottom left square
"With this 3x3 grid, you craft map extensions"
With map extensions you can… extend your map :D
You use materials to craft Biome Tiles
Use those Biome Tiles to create the map extension you want
"Then, place it adjacent to your map."
"P.D. those things you see around your map, are extensions"
that you haven’t reached yet. Try getting to them!
"Here, you can craft Time Buffs. Each one will make the cycle faster"
"If you create a Time Buff using Materials, the Material cycle will be faster"
Same with resources.
"Here, you can craft Biome Buffs. Each one will make a biome to"
produce more Materials/Resources each cycle.
It depends on which Biome you place it
Oh! Your Material Pieces got a special Biome Tile!
You can see them at the left of the screen.
I wonder what would happen if you collect all 9
Great! You collected all 9 Biome Tiles. 
Click the button to see what mystery this Biome will have
Congrats! You completed the game!
Hope you enjoyed the game!
